# Stock Predictions using RNN

In this notebook, we will predict the value of any stock for the past three weeks using a Recurrent Neural Network using the following steps ->
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Building the RNN
3. Making the predictions
4. Visualising the result

When using the notebook, final result will be stored in a folder named 'Predictions' using Plotly.

When using the python file, result will only be displayed using Matplotlib and it will not be saved.
